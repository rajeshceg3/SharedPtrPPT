# Product Requirements: C++ Shared Pointer Slidev Presentation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a Slidev presentation focused on C++ shared pointers (`std::shared_ptr`). The presentation aims to be an educational resource for understanding and effectively using shared pointers in C++ development.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this presentation are to:

*   Educate the audience on the core concepts and mechanics of `std::shared_ptr`.
*   Clearly explain the benefits of using `std::shared_ptr` for memory management (e.g., preventing memory leaks, simplifying resource ownership).
*   Highlight potential pitfalls and common mistakes associated with `std::shared_ptr` usage (e.g., circular dependencies, performance considerations).
*   Provide best practices and practical guidance for using `std::shared_ptr` effectively.
*   Serve as a valuable reference for C++ developers working with smart pointers.

## 3. Target Audience

This presentation is intended for:

*   **C++ Developers:** Professionals working with C++ who want to deepen their understanding or refresh their knowledge of shared pointers.
*   **Students:** Individuals learning C++ who are being introduced to smart pointers and memory management concepts.
*   **Teams:** Software development teams looking to establish consistent practices for using shared pointers in their projects.

A basic understanding of C++ fundamentals (pointers, memory allocation) is assumed.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Core Content

The presentation must cover the following topics in detail:

*   **Introduction to Smart Pointers:** Briefly explain what smart pointers are and why they are needed.
*   **`std::shared_ptr` Overview:**
    *   What is `std::shared_ptr`?
    *   How it works: Reference counting mechanism.
    *   Automatic memory deallocation.
*   **Constructors and Initialization:**
    *   `std::make_shared` (preferred method).
    *   Constructing from a raw pointer (and `std::enable_shared_from_this`).
    *   Copy and move construction/assignment.
*   **Key Methods and Operations:**
    *   `get()`: Accessing the raw pointer.
    *   `reset()`: Releasing ownership or replacing the managed object.
    *   `use_count()`: Understanding the reference count (and its limitations for debugging).
    *   Dereferencing (`*`) and member access (`->`).
*   **Custom Deleters:**
    *   When and how to use custom deleters.
    *   Examples of custom deleters (e.g., for resource handles other than memory).
*   **`std::weak_ptr`:**
    *   Relationship with `std::shared_ptr`.
    *   Breaking circular dependencies.
    *   `lock()` method.
*   **Common Pitfalls and Best Practices:**
    *   Circular dependencies with `std::shared_ptr` and how `std::weak_ptr` solves them.
    *   Performance implications (overhead of reference counting).
    *   Mixing `std::shared_ptr` with raw pointers (potential issues).
    *   Thread safety considerations for the managed object vs. the control block.
    *   Using `std::enable_shared_from_this`.

### 4.2. Code Examples

*   Clear, concise, and illustrative C++ code snippets must be provided for all key concepts.
*   Examples should demonstrate correct usage and common patterns.
*   Code should be well-formatted and easily readable, utilizing Slidev's code highlighting.

### 4.3. Visual Aids

*   Diagrams should be used to explain concepts like:
    *   Reference counting.
    *   Memory layout and ownership with `std::shared_ptr`.
    *   Circular dependencies.
*   Visuals should be clean, simple, and directly relevant to the topic being explained.

### 4.4. Interactive Elements (Nice-to-Have)

*   **Quizzes:** Short, multiple-choice questions to reinforce learning at the end of key sections.
*   **Live Code Examples:** (If feasible with Slidev capabilities) Editable code snippets that users can modify and see results. This is a stretch goal.

### 4.5. Navigation

*   Standard Slidev presentation navigation controls (arrow keys, spacebar).
*   A generated table of contents for easy access to different sections of the presentation.
*   Slide numbers visible.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Theme:** Consistent and professional application of the `@slidev/theme-seriph` theme. Customizations should align with the theme's aesthetic.
*   **Clarity:** All content (text, code, diagrams) must be clear, concise, grammatically correct, and technically accurate.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure good color contrast for text and visuals.
    *   Provide alternative text for images/diagrams where appropriate.
    *   (Slidev handles much of the underlying HTML structure for accessibility).
*   **Performance:** Smooth slide transitions and fast loading times. No noticeable lag.
*   **Maintainability:** The Markdown content should be well-organized and easy to update.

## 6. Technical Details

*   **Framework:** Slidev ([https://sli.dev/](https://sli.dev/))
*   **Primary Language for Content:** Markdown
*   **Language for Customizations (if any):** Vue.js (for custom components or layouts)
*   **Key Dependencies:**
    *   `@slidev/cli`
    *   `@slidev/theme-seriph`
    *   `pnpm` for package management

## 7. Out of Scope (Optional)

The following topics or features will **not** be covered in this presentation:

*   Detailed comparisons with other smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::auto_ptr` - beyond a brief mention of `unique_ptr` as an alternative).
*   Advanced C++ memory management techniques beyond shared pointers.
*   Specific library implementations of shared pointers (e.g., Boost `shared_ptr`, though the concepts are similar).
*   In-depth discussion of atomic operations used in `shared_ptr`'s control block (beyond mentioning thread safety aspects).
